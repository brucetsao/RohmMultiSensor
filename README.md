# RohmMultiSensor

## Arduino library for ROHM Sensor Evaluation Kit

DISCLAIMER: This library is provided 'AS IS'. See `license.txt` for details.

This library is an alternative to the libraries provided by ROHM. See [ROHM webpage](http://www.rohm.com/web/global/sensor-shield-support) for details on the ROHM Sensor Evaluation Kit.

Main purpose of this library is to allow easier, more lightweight interfacing with ROHM sensors.

When using all currently supported sensors with RohmMultiSensor and a simple serial output, the sketch after compilation (for Arduino UNO) uses 20% less program storage space and 30% less dynamic memory that the libraries provided by ROHM need!

Furthemore, RohmMultiSensor is a single library, as opposed to ROHM-provided one-library-per-sensor.

Finally, this library is compliant with Arduino IDE 1.5 specification.
